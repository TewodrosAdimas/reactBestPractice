# React Best Practice Projects

This repository contains a series of small projects designed to demonstrate best practices in React. Each project focuses on specific concepts, such as component reusability, state management, and event handling.

## Projects Overview

1. **helloReact**
   - A simple React component that renders "Hello React" on the screen.
   - Demonstrates the basic structure of a functional React component.

2. **properties**
   - Renders "Hello React" by passing a property (`props`) to the component.
   - Shows how to use properties to customize component behavior and content.

3. **counter**
   - A basic counter application with "Up" and "Down" buttons.
   - Displays the current count, which increases when clicking "Up" and decreases when clicking "Down".
   - Focuses on state management and event handling with Reactâ€™s `useState` hook.

4. **calculator**
   - A fully functional calculator that performs basic arithmetic operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division).
   - Features include chained operations and clear functionality.
   - Demonstrates more advanced state management and component composition.

## Getting Started

Each project is a standalone React component or set of components. To run any project:

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/TewodrosAdimas/reactBestPractice.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the project folder:
   ```bash
   cd reactBestPractice/{your interest of project}
   ```
3. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```
4. Start the application:
   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

Each project can be imported individually into a main `App` component for testing and viewing in the browser.

## Project Structure

- Each project is contained within its own folder inside `reactBestPractice`.
- Shared dependencies and configurations are managed at the root level for convenience.

## Purpose

These projects serve as an introduction to various React concepts and are suitable for beginners and anyone looking to refresh their understanding of React basics.
